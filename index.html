<h1>You can't trust the numbers when it comes to drugs</h1>
<h2>Why the data is unreliable and what to look at instead to understand the market </h2>
<h7>Lydia Chain

<p>The global drug trade is worth <a href="http://www.cicad.oas.org/drogas/elinforme/informeDrogas2013/laEconomicaNarcotrafico_ENG.pdf">hundreds of billions of dollars</a>.  It is a root of violence, crime, and gang activity.  But how can we go about understanding the scope of the problem when the trade is underground?  What do we do when the data is literally &lsquo;off the books?&rsquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s tempting to grab onto what little data is available to explain trends and seek solutions.  Each year, nations submit a report to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime about the quantity of illegal susbstances they have seized. While there are some complications with reconciling disparate units and drug classifications, we end up with a concrete number to analyze. Unfortunately, this data may also be misleading.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will not tell the whole story,&rdquo; said <a href="http://www.as.miami.edu/international-studies/people/ins-department-faculty/bruce-m-bagley/">Bruce Bagley</a>, who studies drug trafficking at the University of Miami. </p>

<p>Take the proliferation of drug smuggling routes as the United States has tried to play &ldquo;Whack-a-Mole,&rdquo; as Bagley says, with the cocaine industry.  Over the past quarter-century, the US has spent billions of dollars trying to block drug smuggling, but our efforts have just made the cartels get more creative, jumping between countries and coasts and expanding across the world.
</p>

<p>This animation shows the amount of cocaine each government has seized annually since 1985.  You can see the amounts increasing and more countries seizing cocaine, but how accurate it is, really?
 </p>

<h4> Amount of Cocaine Seized </h3>
<div>
  <img src=map.gif>
</div>

<div class = "legend", id = "max">
    
  </div>
<div clas = "label">
  500,000+ kg
</div>


<p>There are some major issues with conflating seizure data with the amount of drug actually in a given country.  Funnily enough, we can use the seizure data itself to show that.</p>

<h3>1. The amount of drugs seized may not represent how much drug is actually in a country </h3>

<div class= "chart", id = "marijuana">
<img src="image002.png">

    
  </div>

<p>That enormous spike in Mexico&rsquo;s drug seizures was the result of a single drug bust, as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/23/world/vast-undreamed-of-drug-use-feared.html">reported</a> by the New York Times.  Officials found eight times more marijuana than anyone thought Mexico even produced annually.  Colombia had a <a href="http://www.dea.gov/about/history/1980-1985.pdf">similar story</a> in 1983 and 1984. You can&rsquo;t look at a seizure number and assume it represents how many drugs are actually in the country.
</p>

<h3>2. Corruption warps the numbers </h3>

<div class = "chart", id = "cocaine"> 
    <img src="image003.png">
</div>

<p>If officials have been bribed to let drugs through their inspection areas, &ldquo;seizure&rdquo; data is useless.  Bagley says Guatemala has become a major conduit for cocaine products, but the seizure data does not reflect this. Instead, it looks like there is only a minimal amount of cocaine flowing through Guatemala.  The 2014 International Narcotics Control Strategy <a href="http://www.state.gov/j/inl/rls/nrcrpt/2014/vol1/222894.htm">Report</a> put out by the US State Department positided that 70 percent of the cocaine that enters the United States may flow through Guatemala.  He also pointed out Mexico and Venezuela as countries with corruption that may distort seizure data.</p>

<h3>3. There's no way of knowing if the country consumes the drug or serves as a port to smuggle the drugs elsewhere </h3>

<div class = "chart", id = "hashish"> 
    <img src="image001.png">
</div>

<p>Spain seizes more than twice as much hashish compared to other countries.  But based on this data alone, we can&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a result of the relaxed laws for personal consumption or because of the physical proximity across the Straits of Gibralter to Morocco, which is one of the major hashish producers in the world.  It&rsquo;s probably both in-country use and a port for the rest of Europe, but we don&rsquo;t know the percentage based on these graphs. Or, it could just indicate comprehensive drug trafficing laws and a strong police force.</p>

<p>When I asked Bagley how he conducts his own research, what data he analyzes, he laughed and said &ldquo;I spend a lot of time in Latin America and interview everybody. &rdquo;  He has spent his career building personal relationships to better understand cartels and drug smuggling patterns. </p>

<p>Other types of data available on international drug smuggling and consumption problems exist, but each has its own flaws.  Governments can try to survey the population for consumption rates, but that does not show smuggling routes.  Even production information is shakey. Cultivation can occur off the radar, or, as in cocaine's case, the raw material isn't certain to become an illegal substance.  Coca leaves have a variety of medicinal and traditional religious purposes, so knowing how much coca is harvested doesn&rsquo;t necessarily yield insight into how much cocaine is produced.
</p>  

<p> Each of these measures taken alone, like drug seizure data, can show general trends. But only by putting them together with personal sources like Bagley has cultivated can help us piece together the extent of the global drug problem and where resources can be devoted.</p>
